# Library
A small library application from The Odin Project cirriculum.

#Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate knowledge of objects and prototype inheritence learned through The Odin Project cirriculum.

This project simply serves as an exercise in Javascript and is not meant to be used as an actual library or serve any function outside of
demonstrating newly developed skills.

#Demonstrated Skills
Some of the skills demonstrated during this project are:
1) Creating object constructors
2) Creating new objects using the object constructors.
3) Creating a form, and hiding said form.
4) Dynamically creating HTML elements using value's obtained from form inputs.
4) Using template literals to dynamically assign ID's to buttons on newly created elements that correspond with a matching object in an array.
5) UI design: Using color themes and CSS properties to create an interface that is pleasant to look at, not visually striking, but a clear step up
from previous projects.
